# Beijing AQI Predictor

## Overview

The Beijing AQI Predictor is a machine learning and deep learning project focused on forecasting the Air Quality Index (AQI) for Beijing. By analyzing historical air quality and meteorological data, this tool predicts future AQI levels to assist in air quality management and public awareness.

## Features

- **Historical Data Analysis:** Analyzes historical air quality and meteorological data.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Employs machine learning algorithms to forecast AQI levels.
- **Data Visualization:** Visualizes historical trends and future predictions of AQI.
- **Forecasting:** Generates future AQI forecasts based on trained models.

## Dataset

### Context

PM2.5 readings are commonly used to assess air pollution. PM2.5 refers to particulate matter with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers, which is a key indicator of air quality and pollution levels.

### Content

This dataset includes hourly air pollutants data from 12 nationally-controlled air-quality monitoring sites across Beijing. The data comprises:

- **Air-Quality Data:** Provided by the Beijing Municipal Environmental Monitoring Center.
- **Meteorological Data:** Matched with the nearest weather station from the China Meteorological Administration.

The dataset covers the period from March 1st, 2013 to February 28th, 2017.
